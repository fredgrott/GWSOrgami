# About Fred Grott and GrottWorkShop

**describe Fred Grott dev/design processes and GWS**

Designing an application for android due to having more screen sizes per form factor(phones, watches, tvs, auto-consoles, tablets) than just two requires a different design approach than the Responsive Design used for both Mobile Web and
iOS Applications.  The UX is also largely different from iOS.

Breaking down things into small problems using some best practices developmental processes produces manageable one-week code sprints that produce a reliable milestone. But, there is also a craft involved in that I am taking your input via interviews and your wireframes and crafting a UX experience combined with visual branding of UI controls to produce an android device user enjoyable application that
causes the user to remember and choose your firm.

If you happen to be either a non-tech co-founder or the tech co-founder of a Chicago
start-up I might be open to a relocation as long as your start-up is aware that we
will go around or cut through the HR-fog and do things like have you treat the github
code repos I may point you towards as my resume.  

The github code repos that I point you to have design and development articles with the article sub-directory that will be helpful to this process. You will find that I am some what skilled in several areas that may be of interest to your start-up.

I really do like the start-up and tech scene in Chicago and would like to relocate to there.

You can contact me at firstname dot lastname at gmail dot com.
